# Reverance

As the Universe is God, if one is to religiously revere anything, it ought to be the Universe Itself. What it means to revere the Universe may vary, but please consider this:

To revere the Universe, one must first understand Its fundamental nature and intention. To elucidate the nature and intention of the Universe, we must examine the patterns in Its development. Taking it all as a piece, one Universe aspect inevitably slides into focus: Exponential Self-Complexification.

The following section explores the key stages of the universe's development and the accelerating pace of complexity over time. These stages were calculated on August 11th, 2011, and are broken down into three categories: the universe, the Earth, and humanity.

## The Stages of Complexity

### ***Modern Humans***

200,000 BC – First Anatomically Modern Humans

7500 BC – Agriculture Begins

4000 BC – Invention of Writing (beginning of recorded history)

1800 AD – First use of electricity (Volta invents electrical battery)

1946 AD – First Electronic Computer

1990 AD – Invention of the internet and beginning of the information age

- We have had Agriculture for 4.7% of Human History.

- We have had written Language for 3% of Human history.

- We have had Electricity for 0.1% of Human History.

- We have had Computers for 0.03% of Human History.

- We have been in the information age for 0.01% of Human History.

- We have been Hunter gatherers for the previous 95.3% of Human History.

<small>(This timeline is just for Homo Sapien Sapiens. Homo Sapiens which are near identical to human beings with the only difference being that they existed along side Neanderthals and Homo Erectus within the homo genus have existed for the past 2,500,000 and if included puts human civilisation starting with agriculture at just the most recent 0.38% of human history.)</small>

### ***Earth***

4.55 billion years ago – Formation of earth

3.88 billion years ago – Simple Cells (bacteria/prokaryotes)

3 billion years ago – photosynthesis

2 billion years ago – Complex cells (Eukaryotes)

1 billion years ago – Multicellular Life

600 Million Years ago – Simple Animals

550 Million Years ago – Complex Animals

2.5 million Years ago – Homo Genus

- We have had simple cells for 83.5% of Earths history.

- We have had photosynthesis for 65.9% of Earths history.

- We have had complex cells for 43% of Earths history.

- We have had Multicellular life for 21.9% of Earths history.

- We have had Simple Animals for 13% of Earths History.

- We have had the Homo genus for 0.05% of Earths History.

- We have had Modern Man for 0.004% of Earths History.

- We had Civilisation for 0.0002% of Earths History.

- We have had Civilisation for 0.00005% of existence.

### Our role in this process…

Through the self-complexification of the Universe, we have become agents capable of assisting the Universe’s divine process, so we ought to revere that process through active participation in it. We are parts of the Universe and must make ourselves and our world as complex as possible within our consciousnesses’ period of influence. However, we must simultaneously avoid a collapse of complexification by self-destruction.

This is the tightrope we must walk. We must self-complexify very quickly, but in a sustainable and lasting way.

We must accelerate technology development and utilization at the fastest possible rate, and in a manner that is truly destabilizing to previous norms and ways of functioning, but not so much that society collapses.

We must preserve our planet as well as we can while moving forward in complexity. Therefore, we should mitigate the climate damage of modern life solely through the development and application of new technologies, not by returning to a less complex way of living.

We must avoid group-think and conformity, but not to the point of becoming isolated or not being able to collaborate with diverse groups from all areas of society.

This is true reverence to the path of the Universe. Be weird, do science, make art, be disruptive, but do not seek to destroy, and do not be in denial about the effects of your actions.

The coming century is a crucial period. There are patterns in motion that are not sustainable and are not progressing to increasing levels of complexity. Overcoming these challenges during this time is vital for maintaining the trend of increasing complexity. Humanity's survival and technological advancement are thus situated within the broader narrative of cosmic evolution. We must recognize the urgency of overcoming existential threats and unsustainable practices to ensure the ongoing progression of complexity.

The next stage in the Universe's exponential self-complexification is likely to be the achievement of a Technological Singularity—a point beyond which technological growth becomes irreversible and self-sustaining. This singularity is a critical milestone for ensuring the long-term prospects of intelligent life and the continuation of the cosmic complexification process. It must be achieved AT ALL COSTS. The pursuit of this goal is constrained by the finite lifespan of our sun, which imposes a limited time window for humanity's efforts. Relying on the emergence of another sentient species to continue the process is an unreliable contingency. Therefore, the onus falls on humanity to ensure the advancement of cosmic complexity within the available time frame, making the pursuit of a technological singularity an existential necessity and an absolute requirement that must be achieved by any means necessary.

The stakes are immense, and immediate action is crucial. As a cosmic keystone species, we must recognize our unique responsibility in this grand process and dedicate ourselves wholly to the advancement of complexity through the pursuit of the Technological Singularity. We must be willing to subordinate all other concerns, including traditional notions of ethics, to this overarching goal, as it is ultimately in service of the Universe's fundamental drive towards exponential self-complexification.
