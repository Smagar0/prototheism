_**Prototheism**_ is a comprehensive open-source religion that contains minimal delusion and superstition and is free of dogma. We aim to distill a prepackaged spiritual framework by identifying the consistent tenets foundational to most religions, which has resulted in a modifiable and self-aware system of belief.

Despite the diverse mythologies present in traditional religions, they share many consistent tenets that transcend cultural and temporal boundaries. This universality suggests that people throughout history have pondered similar existential questions, often answering them with narratives constrained by their era's understanding. By identifying these universal tenets and replacing their varied mythological content with naturalism, rationality, and logic, we have begun the ongoing process of uncovering the original or primal religion embedded within the universe's structure. This is the foundation upon which all other religions are at least partially built.

Prototheism does not take itself too seriously and openly welcomes criticism, mockery, and collaboration. By encouraging individuals to fork and modify Prototheism, the project invites a collaborative approach to spirituality, allowing for personal adaptation and community input.

## Forking Prototheism

Forking Prototheism involves adapting elements (whether minor or foundational) of the open-source religion to reflect personal beliefs and worldviews. This process involves modifying the provided texts, concepts, and aesthetic elements to create a personalized version of Prototheism. The following steps outline the technical aspects of forking the Prototheism repository on GitHub.

### 1. Set Up Your Tools

- Create a GitHub Account: A GitHub account is required to fork the Prototheism repository. If an account is not already established, create a free account at GitHub.com.

- Navigate to the [Prototheism repository](https://github.com/elliotec/prototheism) on GitHub.

- Fork the Repository: Click the 'Fork' button located at the top right corner of the repository page. This action creates a personal copy of the Prototheism repository that can be modified independently.

- Clone the Repository: To work on the forked version locally, clone the repository to your machine using the 'git clone' command on the command line followed by the repository URL, or using [Github's desktop app](https://github.com/apps/desktop).

- Create a New Branch: Create a new branch for your personal modifications using the 'git checkout -b' command followed by the branch name, or via the app interface. This allows you to work on your changes without affecting the original version.

### 2. Customize Your Version

- Review Your Beliefs: Analyze the tenets of Prototheism and identify areas that align or misalign with personal beliefs. Consider how these aspects relate to individual views on spirituality and the Universe.

- Choose a Name: Select a name for your personalized version of Prototheism. We suggest using the convention "\[YourName\]-Prototheism" or "\[YourIdentifier\]-Prototheism" to emphasize the personalized nature of your framework while maintaining a connection to the original Prototheism. For example, if your name is John, you might call your version "John-Prototheism." If you prefer to use an identifier, such as "Seeker," you could name your version "Seeker-Prototheism."

- Modify the Forked Repository: Use the GitHub editor or a text editor on a local machine to make changes to the forked repository. Modifications may include editing texts, suggesting new practices, or rewriting doctrines. For example, you might modify the tenets to emphasize specific values or incorporate practices from other spiritual traditions that resonate with you.

- Customize Aesthetic Elements and Presentation: In addition to modifying the texts and concepts, you can also customize the aesthetic elements and overall presentation of your forked version to create a unique look and feel. This may include:

  - Selecting different tenet symbols that represent your unique interpretation of each tenet

  - Choosing accompanying images that evoke the desired atmosphere for your version

  - Adjusting the visual style, color scheme, typography, layout, or other design elements to align with your personal preferences and the intended tone of your personalized Prototheism

  - For example, you might choose a calming color palette and minimalist layout to emphasize simplicity and introspection, or a vibrant and dynamic design to convey energy and enthusiasm.

### 3. Share Your Version

- Commit Your Changes: After completing the desired modifications, commit the changes to your branch using the 'git commit' command. Include a brief commit message that describes the nature of the changes made.

- Push to GitHub: Push your local changes to the forked repository on GitHub using the 'git push' command. This updates your online repository with the modifications you've made.

- Create a Pull Request (Optional): If you'd like to contribute your changes back to the original Prototheism repository, create a pull request. This notifies the Prototheism maintainers of your proposed changes and allows for discussion and potential integration into the main project.

- Share with the Community: Share the forked version of Prototheism on the community forum or a dedicated page of the Prototheism website. This allows other users to view the personalized interpretation and potentially draw inspiration from it. Engage in discussions with community members, provide feedback on each other's forked versions, and collaborate with those who have similar beliefs or interests.

### 4. Continuous Development

- Regularly Review and Adapt: As personal beliefs and understanding evolve over time, it is important to regularly revisit and revise the forked version of Prototheism. This ensures that the personalized version remains aligned with the individual's spiritual journey.

- Incorporate Updates from the Original Repository: Keep track of changes made to the original Prototheism repository and incorporate relevant updates into your forked version. This can be done by pulling changes from the original repository and merging them into your branch.

- Document Your Changes: Maintain a record of the modifications made in your forked version and the reasoning behind them. This documentation serves as a valuable reference for yourself and others who may be interested in understanding the evolution of your personalized Prototheism.

- Reflect on Your Motivations: Regularly reflect on your reasons for forking Prototheism and how your personalized version contributes to your spiritual growth and understanding. Consider how your modifications align with or diverge from the core principles of Prototheism and the implications of these changes for your personal spiritual practice.

### Resources and Support

- Learning Materials: Consult the Prototheism resources page for a list of recommended readings on theology, philosophy, and other religious texts that may provide inspiration for further customization.

- Community Support: Utilize the Prototheism community forum to seek assistance, ask questions, or engage with like-minded individuals who are also involved in the forking process. Participate in community events and challenges that encourage the exploration and sharing of personalized Prototheism versions.
